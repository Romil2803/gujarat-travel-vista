      "detailedDescription": "Rani ki Vav, or 'Queen's Stepwell,' is a magnificent stepwell in Patan, built in the 11th century by Queen Udayamati in memory of King Bhimdev I of the Solanki dynasty. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it exemplifies Gujarat’s architectural brilliance with seven levels of intricately carved panels depicting Vishnu’s avatars, celestial beings, and geometric patterns. The stepwell, once a vital water source, also served as a social and religious gathering place. Restored in the 1980s, it offers visitors a glimpse into ancient engineering and artistry, with its deep corridors and shaded galleries providing a cool retreat.",
